## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a dynamic **Charity Events Website** developed for **PROG2002 Web Development II – Assessment 2**.  
It demonstrates the integration of **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MySQL**, and **HTML/JavaScript** to build a full-stack web application that retrieves and displays event data through RESTful APIs.

The system allows users to:
- View upcoming charity events.
- Search for events by date, location, or category.
- View detailed event information.
- Explore event categories and participating organisations.

> ⚙️ The admin and registration features will be added in Assessment 3.
